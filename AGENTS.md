# INSTRUCTION SET FOR AI AGENTS - DO NOT DELETE THIS LINE - AGENTS: DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE.
# This file contains instructions for AI agents on how to handle code modifications.
# Follow these instructions carefully when making changes to the codebase.

## General Guidelines:
- Don't output unnecessary explanations or comments unless specifically requested or really mandatory.

## Code Style:
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself): Avoid code duplication by reusing existing functions and modules.
- Clean Code: If you need comments, it indicates that the code may need refactoring for clarity and should be extracted into well-named functions or modules.
- Consistent Naming Conventions: Use clear and consistent naming conventions for variables, functions, and modules.
- Error Handling: Implement robust error handling to manage potential issues gracefully.
  - Use Error Codes for all Errors (COMPONENTNAME-FUNCTION-CURRENTSTEP) e.g.: SMREPO-UPDPROP-EXECDBQUERY
- Code Readability: Ensure the code is easy to read and understand, with proper indentation and spacing
- Ensure that the Cognitive Complexity of functions does not exceed 15. Refactor complex functions into smaller, manageable pieces.

## Pre-Task Steps:
1. Check if you understood the task requirements.
2. Ask Questions if any part of the task is unclear.

## Workflow:
1. Create a ToDo List
2. Collect Context around semantically near files/methods/functions
3. Implement Test Cases in integration_tests if applicable
4. Modify the Codebase
5. Run Tests and Ensure All Pass
6. Perform Code Review and Refactoring
7. Perform Post-Task Steps

## Post-Task Steps:
- Run linter and formatter on the modified files to ensure code quality and consistency.

## Run Integration Tests
- go test -v ./internal/submodelrepository/integration_tests 
- NEVER USE ADDITIONAL FLAGS (e.g. -run) UNLESS SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED IN THE TASK. ALL TESTS MUST BE RUN TO ENSURE CODE QUALITY AND INTEGRITY.
